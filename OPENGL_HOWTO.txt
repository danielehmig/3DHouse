***** SETTING UP OPENGL TO RUN UNDER VISUAL STUDIO 2013 ON WINDOWS *****
************************************************************************

Download and unzip the cs432Windows.zip from the course website to, for
example, your desktop. This will create a folder cs432Windows that contains
two subfolders: freeglut and glew-1.7.0. We will be using the two
subfolders several times.

Run Visual Studio 2013.

Create a project:
  - FILE->New->Project...
    - select "Empty Project"
    - near bottom:
      - type in name for your project
      - browse for a location for your project (e.g., the desktop)
      - make sure "Create directory for solution" is checked
      - OK

Attempt to build the project:
  - BUILD->Build Solution
    - whether or not this succeeds does not matter, but it creates a "Debug"
      directory in your project

Add the FreeGlut and GLEW DLLs to the project.
  - use Windows to open the project folder (e.g., on the desktop)
  - open the Debug folder
  - copy the freeglut.dll file from freeglut/bin into the Debug folder
    - (ignore the x64 subfolder)
  - copy the glew32.dll file from the glew-1.7.0/bin folder into the Debug
    folder

Specify the include-file folders for FreeGlut and GLEW:
  - Go back to Visual Studio
  - PROJECT->Properties (It may be PROJECT->properities..., where XXX is
    your project name)
    - in left pane
      - expand "Configuration Properties"
      - expand C/C++
      - click on "General"
    - in right (large) pane
      - click on "Additional Include Directories"
        - browse for and add the freeglut/include and glew-1.7.0/include
	  directories to the list
        - the interface for doing this is horrid:
          - click on down-arrow near the right column to open a pop-down menu
          - click on <Edit...>
            - click folder-icon, then the "..." icon to browse
            - browse to folder
            - "Select Folder" button
        - "OK" button gl

Specify the library folders for FreeGlut and GLEW:
  - (while still in the Property page)
  - in left pane
    - expand "Linker"
    - click on "General"
  - in right pane:
    - click on "Additional Library Directories"
    - using same horrid interface as above, browse to and add the
      freeglut/lib and glew-1.7.0/lib directories
  - "OK" button

Specify the names of the library files for FreeGlut and GLEW:
  - (while still in the "XXX Property Pages" page)
  - in left pane
    - expand "Linker" (if not already expanded)
    - click on "Input"
  - in right pane:
    - click on "Additional Dependencies"
    - using same horrid interface as above, add freeglut.lib and glew32.lib;
      this time you don't browse, but just type them in on separate lines
  - "OK" button

Finally, press the "OK" button again to get back to the main project.
  
At this point, the project is set up to run OpenGL programs:
  - you can add new .h and .cpp files by right-clicking on the "Header Files"
    or "Source Files" and selecting Add->NewItem...
  - You can import existing .h and .cpp files similarly by selecting
    Add->ExistingItem... and browsing.
    - Note that this does not make a copy of the file, but simply
      references it. Edits made on the file via Visual Studio will actually
      be made to the original file.
    - If you are using a university lab computer, this should work out
      nicely, as you can keep your source files on your P-drive, and you
      won't lose your work.
      - If you had done an Add->NewItem..., you need to remember to copy
        it back before logging off the university computer. It would be
	better to create an empty file on your P-drive, and then use
	Add->ExistingItem...

You'll need to include
  #include <GL/glew.h>
  #include <GL/freeglut.h>
  #include <GL/freeglut_ext.h>
but if you include cs432.h, they will be included automatically.
